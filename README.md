### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matthew Sanchez

I am a software developer from a social work background.

I began my coding journey in April of 2023 and my goal now is to apply my developer skills to further my career as a software developer.

I am proficent in Javascript and React. I am currently learning python.

I love making applications with simple UIs and helpful form validation.

Other than coding during my freetime I love to watch sports, specifically baseball. I am a baseball nut I love player sabermetrics and analyzing the game beyond the game. I also love gaming!
